# @god#help
2016 Global Game Jam at 5minlab

Become a god, pay attention to people's rituals, grant their wishes, and get more followers as many as possible. Some enthusiastic followers might insist sending you goatsâ€¦which could be quite useful... @god#help is a fast-paced game simulating a god's demanding daily tasks. Make quick decisions not to disappoint the followers, and develop all the cities to the maximum levels to win.
